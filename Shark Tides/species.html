          <h3>Great White Shark</h3>

          <p>
            The Great White Shark is one of the most iconic and powerful predators in the ocean. Growing up to 20 feet long and weighing several tons, it sits at the top of the marine food chain. Its body is perfectly designed for hunting, with a torpedo-shaped form that allows it to move efficiently through the water and reach speeds of over 35 miles per hour. Rows of serrated teeth enable it to tear through tough prey, while its incredible sense of smell can detect a single drop of blood from miles away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Great Whites also possess electroreceptors in their snouts, allowing them to detect the electrical signals produced by living animals. This makes it nearly impossible for prey to hide. Despite their fearsome reputation, Great White Sharks are curious and intelligent animals, and attacks on humans are extremely rare. They play a vital role in maintaining the balance of ocean ecosystems by controlling populations of other marine species.

          <h3>Whale Shark</h3>

          <p>
            The Whale Shark is the largest fish in the world, reaching lengths of over 40 feet. Despite its enormous size, it is completely harmless to humans. Unlike predatory sharks, the Whale Shark feeds by filtering plankton, fish eggs, and tiny organisms from the water. It swims slowly with its massive mouth open, allowing water to flow through specialized filters that trap its food.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each Whale Shark has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes, much like a human fingerprint. These gentle giants migrate thousands of miles across oceans, following food sources. Their calm nature and impressive size make them one of the most awe-inspiring creatures in the sea. Seeing a Whale Shark in the wild is considered one of the greatest experiences in marine exploration.

          <h3>Tiger Shark</h3>

          <p>
            Tiger Sharks are named for the dark vertical stripes that run along their bodies, especially visible when they are young. These sharks are powerful and versatile hunters, capable of living in a wide range of ocean environments. They can grow up to 16 feet long and are known for their strong jaws and uniquely shaped teeth, which allow them to crush hard shells and bones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tiger Sharks have one of the most diverse diets of any shark species. They eat fish, turtles, birds, and even other sharks. Their adaptability and strength make them one of the ocean’s most successful predators. They are primarily nocturnal hunters, using stealth and surprise to capture prey under the cover of darkness.

          <h3>Hammerhead Shark</h3>

          <p>
            Hammerhead Sharks are instantly recognizable due to their unusual hammer-shaped heads, called cephalofoils. This unique structure gives them a wider field of vision, allowing them to see above and below at the same time. It also improves their ability to detect electrical signals from prey hidden beneath the sand.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Hammerhead species are known to form large schools, swimming together in groups of hundreds. This behavior is unusual among sharks, which are often solitary. Their specialized head shape makes them highly effective hunters, particularly when searching for stingrays, one of their favorite foods.

          <h3>Bull Shark</h3>

          <p>
            Bull Sharks are known for their strength, aggression, and incredible adaptability. Unlike most sharks, they can survive in both saltwater and freshwater environments. They have been found in rivers, lakes, and even far inland from the ocean. This ability makes them one of the most versatile sharks in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their stocky bodies and powerful muscles make them formidable predators. Bull Sharks often patrol shallow coastal waters, where they hunt fish and other marine animals. Their adaptability allows them to thrive in environments where other sharks cannot survive.
